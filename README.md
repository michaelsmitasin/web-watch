# web-watch

web-watch is a tool for uploading website screenshots to a Vision Language model for analysis to determine whether they are hijacked or vulnerable to subdomain hijacking.

Installation:

Ensure you have all the dependencies listed in dependencies_list (the scripts will fail and tell you what you're missing if not).
copy settings.conf.example to settings.conf and modify the relevant variables, especially the GOWITNESSCMD, VLMAPIURL, and VLMAPIKEY.
